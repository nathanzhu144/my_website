            I was seven years old, and I had a problem. My train tracks spanned the whole downstairs,
            but I was never able to conquer the mountainous terrain of the stairs. So, I embarked on
            an all-day campaign to construct an ascent route up the treacherous, winding landscape of
            our stairwell.

            <br> <br>

            I am surprised I did not discover coding earlier. While I have most certainly grown
            since my train track days, I have retained my passion for building intricate creations,
            and have a demonstrated history of delivering results.

            Here are some of my projects.

            where crash-land into a dark forest, and are confronted with a predicament. To escape,
            you must collect all of the pieces of your ship.
